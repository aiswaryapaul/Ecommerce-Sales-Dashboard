## DAX Practice â€“ Basic Measures & Calculated Columns

This folder contains my very first practice using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI.

ðŸ§® What I practiced:
- Calculated columns (e.g. Profit = Sales - Cost)
- Simple measures (e.g. Total Sales, Average Discount)
- Using slicers and filters for dynamic insights

This is a part of my continuous learning journey ðŸ“ˆâœ¨
